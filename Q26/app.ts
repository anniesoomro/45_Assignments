// 26.	Alien Colors #2: Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 25, and write an if-else chain.
// • If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.
// • If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.
// • Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.

// Version that runs the if block:

// alian_color = "Green";
// if (alian_color == "Green") {
     //   console.log("You just earned 5 points for shooting the alian!");
// } else {
    //console.log("You just earned 10 ponits");
// }

// Version that runs the else block:

let alian_color = "Yellow";
if (alian_color == "Grren") {
    console.log("You just earned 5 points for shooting the alian!");
} else {
    console.log("You just earned 10 points.");
}
