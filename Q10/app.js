// 10. Adding comments: Choose two of the programs you've written, and atleast one comment to each. If you don't have anything specific to write beacuse your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date add the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.
//my name is QURRATULAIN SOOMRO
//Dated: 24/03/2024
//this program will run simple code just like hello world
console.log('Hello world simple program');
